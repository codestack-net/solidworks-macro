SOLIDWORKS macro is the most popular way for complimenting SOLIDWORKS functionality via SOLIDWORKS API.

SOLIDWORKS enables macro creation in 3 popular programming languages:

* VBA - the most common language for writing macros. This language is based on popular Visual Basic. Macro is saved in *.swp or *.swb format and it is both executable and source code.
* C# and VB.NET - powered by Microsoft's Visual Studio for Applications (VSTA) technology. This option enables writing the powerful object-oriented macros in the .NET technology. Macro project is saved as *.csproj or *.vbproj projects. Macro executable is a compiled *.dll with referenced SOLIDWORKS interops.
